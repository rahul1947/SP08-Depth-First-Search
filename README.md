### Problems:

#### A. Team Task: 

**Problem 1.**
   Implement topologicalOrdering1().
   This is the DFS-based algorithm for finding the topological ordering
   of a directed acyclic graph.

**Solution:** [DFS.java](https://github.com/rahul1947/SP08-Depth-First-Search/blob/master/DFS.java)


#### B. Individual Tasks (optional):

**Problem 2.**
   Implement topologicalOrdering2(g).
   In this algorithm discussed in class, we keep removing
   nodes with no incoming edges.

**Solution:** [DFS.java](https://github.com/rahul1947/SP08-Depth-First-Search/blob/master/DFS.java)


**Problem 3.**
   Implement connectedComponents().
   In this algorithm, use DFS to find the number of connected components
   of a given undirected graph. Each node gets a cno (component number).
   All nodes in the same connected component receive the same cno.

**Solution:** [DFS.java](https://github.com/rahul1947/SP08-Depth-First-Search/blob/master/DFS.java)
